### Briefly About Myself:
At the moment I have mastered the basic
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and acquired knowledge
of the principles of OOP. For now I am focused
on studying React. I have some experience in
website layout using Bootstrap. I am able to
work in Figma, also I have knowledge of
Photoshop at the level of "cutting" layouts. I
have the skills of user interface scripts binding
that provide visualization and animation of
websites.

As a result of going through the practice and
completing various tasks that I set for myself, I
discovered my strengths and weaknesses and
thanks to this I continue to improve my skills at
the moment. I have a great desire to learn and
improve my skills in the web development field.
I have a great desire to develop myself in the field of IT.

*Implement the inArray function, which will check if the array contains an element with a value or not. Quick parameter function
must take a value, and the owner must be an array. If there is such an element, the function should return true, and if not, false.*

~~~
function inArray(value, mass) {
  for (var i = 0; i < mass.length; i++) {
    if (mass[i] == value) {
      return true;
    }
  }
    return false;
}
 variable mass = [5, 3, 2, 8, 10];
 console.log(inArray(9, mass));
