### Briefly About Myself:
At the moment I have mastered the basic
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and acquired knowledge
of the principles of OOP. For now I am focused
on studying React. I have some experience in
website layout using Bootstrap. I am able to
work in Figma, also I have knowledge of
Photoshop at the level of "cutting" layouts. I
have the skills of user interface scripts binding
that provide visualization and animation of
websites.

As a result of going through the practice and
completing various tasks that I set for myself, I
discovered my strengths and weaknesses and
thanks to this I continue to improve my skills at
the moment. I have a great desire to learn and
improve my skills in the web development field.
I have a great desire to develop myself in the field of IT.
